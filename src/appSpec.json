      "paletteUsageGuide": "Use the 'primary' color as the main background for key sections to establish a calm and grounded atmosphere, with text in 'primaryForeground' for high contrast and readability. The 'secondary' color serves as a warm, soft background for content blocks, paired with 'secondaryForeground' text to maintain clarity. The 'softAccent' color is ideal for subtle highlights, decorative elements, and backgrounds in navigation bars to add warmth without overpowering. Buttons should use 'buttonBackground' with 'buttonForeground' text for clear call-to-actions. Borders and subtle dividers can use 'borderSubtle' to gently separate content areas. This palette ensures a harmonious, accessible, and elegant visual experience.",
      "paletteAccessibilityNotes": "The 'primary' background with 'primaryForeground' text meets WCAG AA standards for large and normal text, ensuring readability. The 'secondary' background with 'secondaryForeground' text also meets WCAG AA contrast ratios. Buttons using 'buttonBackground' with 'buttonForeground' text provide sufficient contrast for accessibility. The 'softAccent' color is used sparingly to maintain contrast and avoid accessibility issues."
